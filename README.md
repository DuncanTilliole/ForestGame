# Fox Runner Project - Unity C#

## Project Description
The Fox Runner project is a game developed in Unity using the C# programming language. The main objective of this project is to create and test a simple 3D game. In this game, the player controls a fox that runs faster and faster through a procedurally generated environment, with increasingly complex obstacles to dodge.

## Game Features
- Fox Control: Players can control the fox by making movements to the left, right, and by performing jumps.
- Increasing Speed: The fox's speed increases gradually as the game progresses, making the challenge increasingly difficult.
- Obstacles: Various types and shapes of obstacles appear on the course, requiring quick reflexes to dodge them.
- Bonuses: Bonuses can be collected to slow down the fox, earn points, or gain other temporary advantages.

## Game Controls
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move the fox horizontally.
- Press the jump key to make the fox jump over obstacles.

## Notes
This project is intended to serve as a foundation for learning and developing 3D games with Unity and C#. Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code according to your needs and creativity!
